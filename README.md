## Hi there 👋

I'm interested in learning about Machine Learning and developing specialized AI agents for specific tasks.
I'm currently working on developing my coding knowledge at Lafayette College so that I will be able to work on independent projects.
In my spare time, I enjoy tossing the frisbee as a part of Lafayette's club frisbee team, go Aflicktion!
